# Object-Oriented Design Pattern Detection
This repository serves as the code base for the project developed as part of the Object-Oriented Design course at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. The project is implemented in Java and focuses on parsing an entire code base to extract essential features of each class. These features encompass association relations, inheritance hierarchy, overridden methods, and more, which are then used to visualize the relationships between classes using a graph representation. Furthermore, the project leverages these features to identify candidate Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns within the code base. The identification is based on similarity scoring techniques detailed in the paper titled **"Design Pattern Detection Using Similarity Scoring"** by Nikolaos Tsantalis et al.

# Key Features
- **Code Base Analysis**: The system performs an in-depth analysis of the code base, extracting critical information about class relationships and structures.

- **Graph Visualization**: The extracted data is represented graphically, providing a clear and intuitive visualization of class relationships, associations, and hierarchies.

- **Design Pattern Detection**: By applying similarity scoring algorithms outlined in the research paper, the system identifies potential design patterns within the code base, helping developers adhere to best practices and improve software design.
